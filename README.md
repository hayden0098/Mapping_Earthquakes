# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview Of Project
To build insightful data visualization with interactive features on Earthquakes from around the world. Basil, the head of the earthquake disaster response team believes the project will be useful for his team which includes reporters and data visualization specialists. He hopes that making earthquake maps informative and easy to use on desktop and mobile phone will generate positive buzz about the Disaster Reporting Network. We will support website and mobil application development by using the latest earthquak GeoJSON data from US Geological Survey website. We will traverse and retrieve the data using JavaScript and D3 and Leaflet libraries and plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request. On the map, the magnitude and location of earthquake will be shown in popup marker. The diameter of the markers for each earthquake should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker in color with a legend providing the context for your map data. Finally, to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates we will add fault line on the map.

Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

Below are the website looks like:
